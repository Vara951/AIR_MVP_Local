1. Database architecture
    incidents:
      - id               (PK, e.g., "INC-001")
      - title            (Short summary)
      - description      (What happened)
      - tech_stack       (java/python/nodejs)
      - error_type       (TIMEOUT/NULL_REFERENCE/MEMORY_LEAK)
      - root_cause       (Why it happened - KEY for cross-stack learning)
      - solution         (Array of fix steps)
      - service          (Which microservice - context)

3. Test Cases
    TEST QUERIES (Based on Your Database)
    Copy-paste these into your UI to test:

    Test 1: Database Connection Pool (Java)
    text
    Description:
    Payment processing timing out. Stripe API calls failing after 30 seconds. 2000+ customers affected during checkout. Connection pool appears exhausted.

    Tech Stack: java

    Error: java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out after 30000ms
    Expected: Should find INC-001 (Stripe timeout) and INC-006 (Python pool exhausted) as cross-stack

    Test 2: Null Reference (Python)
    text
    Description: User profile update API crashing. Happens when user deletes account but session is still active. Getting error when trying to access user email.

    Tech Stack: python

    Error: AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'email'
    Expected: Should find INC-021 (Python AttributeError) and INC-016 (Java NullPointer) as cross-stack

    Test 3: Memory Leak (Node.js)
    text
    Description: API gateway memory growing from 200MB to 4GB over 6 hours. Server crashes requiring restart. 5000+ concurrent WebSocket connections.

    Tech Stack: nodejs

    Error: FATAL ERROR: JavaScript heap out of memory
    Expected: Should find INC-041 (EventEmitter leak) and INC-031 (Java cache leak) as cross-stack

    Test 4: MongoDB Slow Query (Node.js)
    text
    Description: Product search taking 30+ seconds. Checkout flow blocked. Database scanning entire collection on every search query.

    Tech Stack: nodejs

    Error: MongoNetworkError: connection timed out
    Expected: Should find INC-012 (MongoDB no index) and similar timeout patterns

    Test 5: Kafka Consumer Lag (Java)
    text
    Description: Order confirmation messages delayed 15+ minutes. Kafka consumer lag at 50K messages. Orders not updating in real-time.

    Tech Stack: java

    Error: TimeoutException: Failed to send messages after 60000 ms
    Expected: Should find INC-003 (Kafka lag) and similar timeout issues

    Test 6: Redis Cache Timeout (Python)
    text
    Description: User profile API extremely slow. Redis taking 5+ seconds per read. Cache hit actually slower than database query.

    Tech Stack: python

    Error: redis.exceptions.TimeoutError: Timeout reading from socket
    Expected: Should find INC-008 (Redis timeout) and connection pool issues
